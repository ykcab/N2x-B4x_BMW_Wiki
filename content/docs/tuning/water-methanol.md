> **Important:** Water-methanol injection is an advanced modification that requires careful setup and monitoring. Improper installation or tuning can cause engine damage.

## Overview

Water-methanol injection (WMI) is a powerful tool for reducing intake temperatures and preventing detonation. This guide covers installation, tuning, and maintenance of WMI systems.

## Benefits

1. Lower intake temperatures
2. Increased octane rating
3. Reduced risk of detonation
4. Potential for more aggressive timing
5. Cleaner intake valves

## Installation

### Required Components
- WMI kit (pump, controller, nozzle)
- Methanol-safe lines and fittings
- Boost/MAP sensor
- Failsafe device
- Proper mixture (50/50 water/methanol)

### Mounting Locations
1. Pump: Protected area near tank
2. Tank: Trunk or spare tire well
3. Nozzle: Pre-throttle body
4. Controller: Accessible location

## Tuning

### Initial Setup
1. Start with conservative settings
2. Begin injection at 5-7 PSI
3. Progressive ramping to max boost
4. Monitor AFRs and timing

### Safety Measures
1. Install failsafe device
2. Monitor fluid levels
3. Regular system checks
4. Conservative tune initially

## Maintenance

1. Regular system inspection
2. Clean nozzles periodically
3. Check for leaks
4. Monitor fluid consumption
5. Test mixture ratio

## System Components

### Basic Components
- Reservoir tank
- High-pressure pump
- Injection nozzle(s)
- Controller unit
- Pressure sensor
- Flow sensor (optional)
- Solenoid (optional)

### Popular Systems
1. **Snow Performance**
   - Stage 2 Boost Cooler
   - Stage 3 Boost Cooler
   - MAX-MPG System

2. **AEM**
   - V2 Water/Methanol Kit
   - X-Series Kit

3. **BMS**
   - Methanol Injection System
   - Dual Nozzle Kit

## Installation

### Mounting Locations
- Reservoir: Trunk or engine bay
- Pump: Near reservoir
- Nozzle: Pre-throttle body or post-intercooler
- Controller: Inside cabin

### Nozzle Sizing
- Single Nozzle: 175-375ml/min
- Dual Nozzle: 2x 175ml/min
- Based on power goals and boost levels

## Tuning Considerations

### Mixture Ratio
- 50/50 Water/Methanol: Safe starting point
- 70/30 Water/Methanol: Maximum cooling
- 30/70 Water/Methanol: Maximum octane boost

### Activation Points
- Start: 10-12 PSI
- Full: 15-18 PSI
- Progressive ramping recommended

## Safety Features

### Required Safeguards
- Low fluid sensor
- Flow sensor
- Boost safety solenoid
- Failsafe tune map

### Monitoring
- Fluid level
- System pressure
- Flow rate
- Nozzle condition

## Power Gains

### N20 Engine
- Stage 2: +20-30hp
- Stage 2+: +30-40hp
- Stage 3: +40-50hp

### B48 Engine
- Stage 2: +25-35hp
- Stage 2+: +35-45hp
- Stage 3: +45-55hp

## Maintenance

### Regular Checks
- Filter cleaning
- Nozzle inspection
- Line condition
- Pump operation
- Fluid level

### Recommended Intervals
- Nozzle cleaning: Every 10,000 miles
- Filter change: Every 20,000 miles
- System flush: Every 30,000 miles
- Pump inspection: Every 30,000 miles
