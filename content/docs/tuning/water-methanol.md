Water methanol injection is an advanced modification that helps reduce intake temperatures and prevent detonation, allowing for more aggressive tuning on both N20 and B48 engines.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

## Overview

Water methanol injection (WMI) systems spray a mixture of water and methanol into the intake tract to:
- Lower intake temperatures
- Increase octane rating
- Reduce risk of detonation
- Allow for more aggressive tuning
- Clean carbon deposits

## System Components

### Basic Components
- Reservoir tank
- High-pressure pump
- Injection nozzle(s)
- Controller unit
- Pressure sensor
- Flow sensor (optional)
- Solenoid (optional)

### Popular Systems
1. **Snow Performance**
   - Stage 2 Boost Cooler
   - Stage 3 Boost Cooler
   - MAX-MPG System

2. **AEM**
   - V2 Water/Methanol Kit
   - X-Series Kit

3. **BMS**
   - Methanol Injection System
   - Dual Nozzle Kit

## Installation

### Mounting Locations
- Reservoir: Trunk or engine bay
- Pump: Near reservoir
- Nozzle: Pre-throttle body or post-intercooler
- Controller: Inside cabin

### Nozzle Sizing
- Single Nozzle: 175-375ml/min
- Dual Nozzle: 2x 175ml/min
- Based on power goals and boost levels

## Tuning Considerations

### Mixture Ratio
- 50/50 Water/Methanol: Safe starting point
- 70/30 Water/Methanol: Maximum cooling
- 30/70 Water/Methanol: Maximum octane boost

### Activation Points
- Start: 10-12 PSI
- Full: 15-18 PSI
- Progressive ramping recommended

## Safety Features

### Required Safeguards
- Low fluid sensor
- Flow sensor
- Boost safety solenoid
- Failsafe tune map

### Monitoring
- Fluid level
- System pressure
- Flow rate
- Nozzle condition

## Power Gains

### N20 Engine
- Stage 2: +20-30hp
- Stage 2+: +30-40hp
- Stage 3: +40-50hp

### B48 Engine
- Stage 2: +25-35hp
- Stage 2+: +35-45hp
- Stage 3: +45-55hp

## Maintenance

### Regular Checks
- Filter cleaning
- Nozzle inspection
- Line condition
- Pump operation
- Fluid level

### Recommended Intervals
- Nozzle cleaning: Every 10,000 miles
- Filter change: Every 20,000 miles
- System flush: Every 30,000 miles
- Pump inspection: Every 30,000 miles

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. Low Flow
   - Clogged filter
   - Faulty pump
   - Nozzle blockage
   - Air in lines

2. System Cuts Out
   - Low fluid
   - Electrical issues
   - Pump failure
   - Controller malfunction

3. Poor Atomization
   - Worn nozzle
   - Low pressure
   - Incorrect nozzle size
   - Contaminated fluid

## Best Practices

1. **Quality Components**
   - Use high-quality lines
   - Premium nozzles
   - Reliable controller
   - Name brand pump

2. **Installation**
   - Proper line routing
   - Secure mounting
   - Quality electrical connections
   - Easy access for maintenance

3. **Operation**
   - Regular testing
   - System monitoring
   - Proper mixture ratio
   - Clean methanol source
