## Factory Block Construction

The N20/N26 engines use an aluminum block with an arc spray process applied to the cylinder walls from the factory. This process involves:

![Factory Block Construction](/images/engine-mods/n20/factory-block.png)

- Aluminum block base material
- Arc-sprayed cylinder coating
- Open deck design from factory
- Integrated coolant passages

## Sleeve Options

### 1. Parallel/Repair Sleeve

The most basic and economical sleeve option, but with significant limitations:

![Parallel Sleeve Design](/images/engine-mods/n20/parallel-sleeve.png)

**Pros:**
- Most affordable option
- Good for OEM-style rebuilds
- Simpler installation process

**Cons:**
- Not recommended for high-power applications
- Risk of sleeve dropping issues
- Potential problems with Athena "Cut-Ring" head gaskets
- Limited power handling capability

### 2. Flanged Sleeve

A more robust option commonly used in BMW engines:

**Pros:**
- Better retention than parallel sleeves
- More surface area at top prevents dropping
- Proven in many BMW applications

**Cons:**
- Risk of cracking in high-performance builds
- Wall thickness limitations
- Potential coolant passage interference
- Cylinder movement possible in open deck design

### 3. Darton MID Wet Sleeve

The premium solution developed specifically for the N20/N26 by Navardi Tuned in conjunction with Darton Sleeves International Inc and Brintech Customs Australia:

**Pros:**
- Integrated closed deck design
- Thicker cylinder walls (3.5mm between cylinders)
- Better heat transfer characteristics
- Triple O-ring sealing system
- Replaceable individual cylinders
- Maximum power handling capability

**Cons:**
- Higher cost
- Longer lead times (12-18 weeks)
- Requires CNC machining for installation
- Limited availability of qualified installers

## Power Handling Recommendations

- **Stock/Stage 2:** Factory arc spray or parallel sleeve
- **Up to 400WHP:** Flanged sleeve with closed deck
- **400WHP+:** Darton MID wet sleeve recommended

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
For applications above 400WHP at boost pressures over 30psi, we strongly recommend either:
1. Darton MID Wet Sleeve (preferred)
2. Flanged sleeve with closed deck conversion

## Technical Specifications

### Darton MID Wet Sleeve
- Wall thickness between cylinders: ~3.5mm
- Thrust/non-thrust wall thickness: ~8mm
- Maximum bore size capability: 85mm
- Triple O-ring sealing system
- Designed for easy replacement

### Flanged Sleeve
- Typical wall thickness: 1.8-1.9mm
- Must maintain minimum coolant passage thickness
- Available in 84mm and 84.5mm sizes

## Installation Considerations

1. **Machine Shop Requirements:**
   - 3-axis CNC machine required for Darton sleeves
   - Precision boring equipment
   - Experience with BMW aluminum blocks
   
2. **Additional Modifications:**
   - Consider closed deck conversion
   - Update head studs/bolts
   - Verify head gasket compatibility
   
3. **Quality Control:**
   - Pressure testing after installation
   - Deck surface finish verification
   - Cylinder roundness checking
   - Alignment verification

## Manufacturer Recommendations

For high-performance builds, we recommend:
1. Darton MID Wet Sleeves (preferred)
2. Custom Darton flanged sleeves
3. LA Sleeves options

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}
Due to the large number of failed built/forged engines observed, we strongly recommend the Darton MID Wet Sleeve solution for any serious performance build.
