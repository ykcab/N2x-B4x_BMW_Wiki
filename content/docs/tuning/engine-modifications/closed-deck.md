# Closed Deck Conversion

## Overview

Closed deck conversion strengthens the cylinder walls for high-power applications. Benefits include:
- Increased cylinder stability
- Higher boost capability
- Reduced cylinder distortion
- Maximum block strength

## Conversion Options

### Methods
1. Full Plate
   - Maximum strength
   - Complete deck closure
   - Custom coolant passages
   - Requires specialized machining

2. Partial Fill
   - Moderate strength increase
   - Maintains some cooling
   - Less machining required
   - More common approach

### Materials
| Type | Material | Strength | Cost |
|------|----------|----------|------|
| OEM | Aluminum | Base | - |
| Stage 1 | Steel Insert | High | $$ |
| Stage 2 | Billet Plate | Maximum | $$$ |

## Technical Specifications

### Deck Measurements
| Area | Stock | Converted |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Deck Thickness | 8mm | 12mm |
| Support Area | 60% | 90% |
| Coolant Area | 40% | 10% |
| Wall Strength | Base | +300% |

## Installation Process

### Requirements
1. Block machining center
2. Specialized tooling
3. Professional installation
4. Block blueprinting
5. Custom coolant routing

### Process Steps
1. Block preparation
2. Deck surface machining
3. Plate/insert fitting
4. Coolant passage modification
5. Final machining
6. Pressure testing
7. Surface finishing

## Performance Implications

### Power Handling
| Configuration | Max Boost | Max HP |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| Stock | 30 psi | 600 |
| Partial Fill | 40 psi | 800 |
| Full Plate | 50+ psi | 1000+ |

### Considerations
1. Cooling system modifications
2. Head gasket selection
3. Head stud requirements
4. Tuning adjustments
5. Break-in procedure

## Required Supporting Mods

### Minimum Requirements
1. Head studs
2. MLS head gasket
3. Upgraded cooling
4. Oil system mods
5. Built bottom end

### Recommended Additions
1. Oil cooler
2. Upgraded radiator
3. Electric water pump
4. Oil catch can
5. Coolant reroute

## Maintenance

### Regular Checks
- Coolant temperature
- Oil temperature
- Cylinder pressure
- Head gasket condition
- Coolant chemistry

### Service Intervals
- Coolant: Every 20k miles
- Head retorque: First 1k miles
- Pressure test: Annually
- Gasket inspection: With head removal

## Recommendations

### Street/Race
- Partial fill method
- Upgraded cooling
- Conservative boost
- Regular monitoring

### Competition
- Full plate conversion
- Maximum cooling
- Race-spec gaskets
- Data logging required
