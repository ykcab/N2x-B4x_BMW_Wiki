# Cylinder Head Modifications

## Overview

Cylinder head modifications improve airflow and combustion efficiency. Benefits include:
- Increased volumetric efficiency
- Better cylinder filling
- Higher RPM capability
- Improved power output

## Available Services

### Basic Services
- Multi-angle valve job
- Port matching
- Chamber cleanup
- Spring upgrade
- Bronze guides

### Advanced Services
- CNC porting
- Oversized valves
- Competition valve job
- Flow bench testing
- Custom spring packages

## Port Specifications

### Flow Numbers (CFM @ 28" H2O)
| Valve Lift | Stock | Stage 1 | Stage 2 |
|------------|-------|---------|---------|
| 0.100" | 45 | 52 | 58 |
| 0.200" | 98 | 112 | 125 |
| 0.300" | 145 | 165 | 180 |
| 0.400" | 175 | 195 | 215 |
| 0.450" | 185 | 205 | 225 |
