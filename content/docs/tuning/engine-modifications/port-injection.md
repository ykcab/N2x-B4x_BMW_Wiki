# Port Injection Systems

## Overview

Port injection (PI) supplements the factory direct injection system. Benefits include:
- Increased fueling capacity
- Cleaner intake valves
- Better fuel atomization
- Support for higher power levels

## System Components

### Required Hardware
- Fuel rail
- Port injectors
- Fuel pressure regulator
- Fuel lines and fittings
- Wiring harness
- Controller unit
- Mounting brackets

### Available Kits
- Full Race Motorsports
- Pure Motorsports
- BMS Dual Fueling
- Nostrum High Flow

## Injector Specifications

### Common Injector Options
| Brand | Flow Rate | Pressure | Compatibility |
|-------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Bosch EV14 | 550cc | 3-5 bar | Universal |
| Injector Dynamics | 725cc | 3-5 bar | Universal |
| Nostrum | 850cc | 3-5 bar | Kit Specific |
| Siemens Deka | 630cc | 3-5 bar | Universal |

## Installation

### Requirements
1. Advanced mechanical skills
2. Specialized tools
3. 6-8 hours
4. Lift access
5. Fuel system knowledge

### Installation Steps
1. Remove intake manifold
2. Install fuel rail
3. Mount injectors
4. Route fuel lines
5. Install controller
6. Wire injectors
7. Program controller
8. Test for leaks

## Tuning Requirements

### Hardware Setup
- Base fuel pressure: 3.5 bar
- Injector duty cycle max: 85%
- Fuel pressure rise rate
- Flow balancing

### Software Setup
- Injector flow matching
- Staging points
- Load-based activation
- Ethanol content scaling
- Fail-safe programming

## Performance Impact

### Power Support
| Setup | Max Power | Fuel Type |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Stock DI | 400whp | Gasoline |
| PI + DI | 800whp | Gasoline |
| PI + DI | 1000whp | E85 |

### Benefits
1. Increased power potential
2. Cleaner combustion
3. Lower injection pressures
4. Better atomization
5. Cooler intake temps

## Maintenance

### Regular Checks
- Fuel pressure
- Injector spray pattern
- Filter condition
- Line integrity
- Controller function

### Service Intervals
- Clean injectors: 15,000 miles
- Replace filters: 10,000 miles
- Check lines: 6 months
- Update tune: As needed

## Recommendations

### Street/Daily
- 550cc injectors
- Conservative tune
- OEM-style integration

### Track/Race
- 725cc+ injectors
- Aggressive tune
- Full monitoring system
