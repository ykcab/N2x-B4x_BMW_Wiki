## Factory Block Construction

The B48 engine family uses an aluminum block with similar construction to the N20/N26:

- Aluminum block base material
- Arc-sprayed cylinder coating
- Integrated coolant passages
- Shares ~90-100% of engine parts with B58 & B38

## Sleeve Options

### 1. Parallel/Repair Sleeve

The basic sleeve option for OEM-style rebuilds:

![B48 Parallel Sleeve](/images/engine-mods/b48/parallel-sleeve.png)

**Pros:**
- Most economical option
- Suitable for stock rebuilds
- Simple installation process

**Cons:**
- Limited to OEM power levels
- Not recommended for performance builds
- Risk of premature wear

### 2. Flanged Sleeve

A more robust option for performance applications:

**Pros:**
- Better retention than parallel sleeves
- Common in BMW performance builds
- Proven track record in 6 and 8 cylinder BMWs

**Cons:**
- Must maintain specific wall thickness
- Risk of coolant passage interference
- Material quality critical for success

## Technical Specifications

### Critical Measurements

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
Flanged sleeve wall thickness must be:
- NO LESS than 0.100 inches
- NO MORE than 0.139 inches
{{% /alert %}}

Exceeding these specifications can:
- Compromise cylinder wall strength
- Risk coolant passage interference
- Lead to mixing of coolant and oil

## Manufacturer Recommendations

For performance applications, we recommend:
1. Custom Darton flanged sleeves
2. LA Sleeves options

Both manufacturers can create sleeves that:
- Maintain proper wall thickness
- Use appropriate materials
- Avoid coolant passage interference
- Provide maximum strength

## Installation Considerations

### Machine Shop Requirements
- Precision boring equipment
- Experience with BMW aluminum blocks
- Proper measuring tools
- Quality control procedures

### Quality Control
- Pressure testing
- Wall thickness verification
- Roundness checking
- Surface finish inspection

## Power Level Guidelines

- **Stock/Stage 1:** Factory arc spray coating
- **Stage 2:** High-quality parallel sleeve
- **Performance Builds:** Custom flanged sleeve

## Integration with Other Modifications

Consider these related upgrades:
- Head studs/bolts
- Performance head gaskets
- Cooling system improvements
- Oil system upgrades
