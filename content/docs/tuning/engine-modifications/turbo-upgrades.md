# N2x Turbo Upgrade Information

For turbo/engine setups aiming for over 500WHP, Nitrous injection or a compound turbo setup is recommended to reduce turbo lag. **To make over 380WHP on an N20 you need an aftermarket Turbo + custom manifold i.e G25-660 then you need to consider the engine internals strength**

Upgraded turbos require a custom map and can max out the stock HPFP and injectors depending on fuel used and climate. Custom manifolds are expensive and time-consuming. A/R turbine housing is important when fitting an aftermarket turbo, and a twin scroll housing + twin scroll (divided) turbo manifold is recommended to ensure optimal spool up. For setups up to 550WHP, a 0.64 A/R turbine housing is sufficient, while for setups up to 750WHP, a 0.72 turbine housing is recommended.

It is recommended to use internally waste-gated turbos for the platform, but external waste-gate setups may be used for PWG models as those DME's support control of MAC Solenoids. Stick to using the factory DME for tuning and management. Port injection is required for setups over 650WHP because there is no "stage 3" HPFP to feed the stage 2 DI injectors.

## Water-Methanol Injection

For high-power builds, water-methanol injection is highly recommended. Benefits include:
- Reduced intake temperatures
- Increased octane rating
- Detonation suppression
- Additional power potential
- Safer operation at high boost
