> **Important:** A downpipe upgrade can significantly improve exhaust flow and turbo response, but requires proper tuning and may affect emissions compliance.

## Types of Downpipes

### Catted Options
1. High-Flow Catalytic
   - 200-cell count
   - GESI catalyst
   - Emissions legal
   - Less sound increase

2. Popular Brands
   - VRSF
   - Wagner
   - ARM
   - Evolution Racewerks

### Catless Options
1. Features
   - Maximum flow
   - Straight-through design
   - Louder sound
   - Off-road use only

2. Considerations
   - Emissions compliance
   - Check engine light
   - Sound levels
   - Tuning requirements

## Installation
