# N20 Spark Plugs

The N20 runs a NGK 97506 Spark Plug factory, below is a chart with information based on observed results using this plug and its possible upgrade/replacement alternatives.

## N2x Plugs

## Pre-Ignition / Detonation Protection Explained

- **Standard:** What was considered standard from the OEM
- **Improved:** This is considered an improvement over the standard by way in which the Metal Shell has been extended to cover/shield more of the electrode (positive firing end) ceramic but does not shield/protect all of the ceramic
- **Enhanced:** This is when the metal shell extension completely covers/shields the electrodes ceramic and provides the most pre-ignition or detonation protection for the ceramic

## Why Projection Type Matters

Projection is how far from the body/shell of the plug the ground strap and conversely electrode extend. The longer or further away from the plug body they are the better spark efficiency but the greater risk of plug failure or potential engine damage from a hot ground strap causing pre-ignition.

## How Much Boost Can These Plugs Handle?

Plug life can vary depending on the application at hand, but typically here are a few things that can reduce plug life:

- **Gapping Plugs:** Gapping a plug can reduce its life as the precious metals on the electrode and ground strap can wear out quicker.
- **Incorrect Heat Range:** Running High Boost Pressures or High Octane Fuels can also lead to a premature failure or reduced service life of the plug.
- **Detonation / Pre-Ignition:** This can cause the ceramic in the plug to prematurely crack and end up becoming dislodged, this usually results in engine failure/piston damage.

## Plug Recommendations

| Plug Model | Ideal Max Service Life | Max Ideal Boost To Promote Ideal Service Life | Reasoning? |
