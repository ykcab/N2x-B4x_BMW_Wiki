# N20 and N26 Servicing & Maintenance Information

(Please take this advice as general in nature and choose what best works for you and your situation).

## N2x Important Performance Recommended Service Intervals

| Component | Interval |
|-----------|----------|
| Engine Oil | 10,000 KM or 5000 KM if using Ethanol Fuels regularly |

| Injectors | 80,000 KM |
| Coolant | 85,000 KM |
| Brake Fluid | 50,000 KM |
| Brake Pads | 50,000 KM or When Indicator Lamp Is Active |
| Intake Filter | 50,000 KM |
| Cabin Filter | 30,000 KM |
| Accessories Belt | 100,000 KM |
| Fuel Filter (If Present) | 50,000 KM |

## N2x Preventative Maintenance/Common Failure Points

### Timing Chain

- Vehicles built **on or before** JAN 2015 Should have their entire **Timing chain + Guides + Sprockets + Tensioner + Oil pump chain, Guides and Sprocket** replaced before the 120,000 KM or 80,000 Miles. This is because throughout 2015, the timing chain & oil pump drive system went through a variety of changes

### Oil Pan Baffles

- RWD N2x, used in a performance/street application should look into having the sump updated to an Aluminium Pan + Baffle plate (URO sell the Aluminium Pan, and Navardi Tuned sells the baffle plates). The stock sump under high lateral left and right turns, including braking, causes the oil to move away from the pickup, causing irreversible engine damage from loss of oil pressure.

### Turbo Feed Line

- Vehicles built before SEP 2015 should have their turbo oil feed line updated, BMW introduced a check valve to stop oil from draining from the turbo and causing bearing damage.

### Diverter Valve

- Diverter Valve upgrade, stock units are known to crack and leak under boost.

### Charge Pipes

- Charge Pipe upgrades, stock units are known to crack and leak under boost with age/heat-cylces.

### Turbo Inlet

- Turbo inlet, stock units are known to crack

### Catch Cans

- Oil Catch Can, helps eliminate carbon /sludge build up within the cylinder head/Intake valves and clean the intake/charge air system from oil and contaminates.

### Connecting Rods

- Known to be weak in the N20/N26, but can be reliable as long as the tune doesn't target high torque especially below 4000 RPM or exceed 550 NM of torque at the crank.

### Pistons

- Cast pistons can fragile in nature, and it's important to ensure the tune does not run too lean as this causes the piston rings to fail or pistons to crack.

### HPFP

- These pumps can fail at delivering correct amounts of fuel when tuned incorrectly or running exotic fuels such as ethanol that exceed the flow capacity of the pump, When the pump begins to fail or fail to deliver the flow demands the AFRs go lean causing piston/engine damage or component damage.

### Cylinder Head Cracking

- Mostly unknown issue, but the issue stems from the threaded seat of the spark plug in the combustion chamber. The go-to fix is to machine down the spark plug seat in the cylinder head to reduce the amount of thin wallet material exposed to the combustion process. Once machined down, a spacer must be installed into the spark plug to ensure no spark plug threads are exposed in the chamber causing hot-spots/detonation.

## Recommended Engine Oils

### Understanding Oil Weight Classifications

- The number in front of the W indicates its viscosity when cold (W refers to Winter) colder temperatures you want a lower viscosity to help with engine start up and oil flow during cold temperatures
- The number after the W indicates its viscosity when the engine is at standard operating temperature of 100Â° Deg C

BMW LL (Long Life) oil ratings are specifications set by BMW for engine oils to ensure optimal performance and longevity of their engines. These ratings indicate the oil's suitability for various engines and driving conditions. The primary BMW LL ratings include:

- **BMW LL-98**: Introduced in 1998, suitable for older gasoline engines. It was the first Long Life oil specification by BMW, designed to support extended oil change intervals.
- **BMW LL-01**: Suitable for gasoline engines, introduced in 2001. It offers extended oil change intervals and high temperature stability.
- **BMW LL-04**: Introduced in 2004, suitable for both gasoline and diesel engines with particulate filters, emphasizing low SAPS (Sulfated Ash, Phosphorus, and Sulfur) to protect emission control systems.
- **BMW LL-12 FE**: Focuses on fuel economy, introduced in 2012, suitable for specific BMW engines requiring low viscosity oils.
- **BMW LL-14 FE+**: Further enhances fuel economy, introduced in 2014, primarily for certain newer gasoline engines.
- **BMW LL-17 FE+**: Introduced in 2017, designed for the latest BMW engines, offering improved fuel economy and protection.

These ratings ensure that the oils meet BMW's stringent requirements for performance, efficiency, and engine protection. However BMW Engines can support the use of a select few other oils meeting other oil grading standards such as:

- **ACEA A3/B3**: High-performance and high-quality oils for gasoline and light-duty diesel engines, offering extended oil change intervals.
- **ACEA A3/B4**: Similar to A3/B3 but also suitable for direct-injection diesel engines.
- **ACEA C3**: Mid-SAPS (Sulfated Ash, Phosphorus, and Sulfur) oils, protecting after-treatment devices such as particulate filters and catalytic converters, suitable for high-performance gasoline and light-duty diesel engines.

Additionally, BMW oils may meet or exceed other international standards such as:

- **API (American Petroleum Institute)**: Common standards like API SN, SN Plus, and SP for gasoline engines, indicating performance levels in terms of protection against deposits, wear, and oil oxidation.
- **ILSAC (International Lubricant Standardization and Approval Committee)**: Standards such as GF-5 and GF-6, focusing on fuel economy, emission control system protection, and enhanced performance under severe conditions.

BMW N2x engines are compatible with all LL ratings, including LL-98 and LL-04. However, the suitability and lifespan of the oil depend on the specific use case. For example, FE-based LL ratings are not designed for performance applications and can cause issues when using fuels like ethanol. Therefore, using an LL-98 rated oil is acceptable as long as it meets or exceeds BMW's standards. The duration of oil use depends on your application, and selecting the appropriate oil is crucial. Using non-LL based oils can pose significant risks since these oils have not been validated for use in BMW engines and should be avoided.

**Below are oils recommended for the N2x engine, these oils are in part based on what the BMW manual recommends and what has worked well from the performance industry standpoint:**

**Worth noting that the oil weights below will not always be 100% what you may need if you have had an engine rebuild in this case refer to your engine builder on what oil weight you should run based on your main and rod bearing clearances**
