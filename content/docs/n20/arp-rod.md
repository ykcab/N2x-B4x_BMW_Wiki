# BMW N20 and N26 ARP Rod Bolt Upgrade

Upgrading the connecting rod bolts to ARP2000 bolts adds an extra layer of security for those that want it, whilst this upgrade does enable you to push an extra 1-2psi throughout the rpm range its still not advised to do so, rather its advised to use this upgrade to just add a further safety net when you are running the engine in either a racing environment or drag setups.

Stock rods can quite capably support 25psi from 4500-7000 RPM but this is just an extra added layer of security as the most common failure point is the rod bolts over stretching and allowing the rod end cap to separate from the rest of the connecting rod.

The part number for these rod bolts is ARP **201-6303**
