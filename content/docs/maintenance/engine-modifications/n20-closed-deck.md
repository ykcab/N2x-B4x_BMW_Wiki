> **Important:** Closed deck conversion is an advanced engine modification that requires professional machining and installation. This modification is typically only necessary for high-horsepower builds.

## Overview

The N20's open deck design can be a limiting factor for high-power builds. A closed deck conversion strengthens the cylinder walls by adding material between the cylinders and the coolant jackets.

## Benefits

1. Increased cylinder stability
2. Better head gasket sealing
3. Reduced cylinder distortion
4. Higher boost capability
5. Improved reliability at high power

## Process

### Preparation
- Engine removal
- Complete disassembly
- Block cleaning
- Surface preparation
- Measurement and marking

### Conversion
1. CNC machining of block
2. Material addition
3. Precision boring
4. Surface finishing
5. Quality control checks

### Reassembly
- New main bearings
- Updated head gasket
- ARP head studs
- Torque plate honing
- Assembly with new parts

## Considerations

### When Needed
- Power goals over 600hp
- Boost over 30 PSI
- Race applications
- Frequent track use

### Supporting Mods
1. Forged internals
2. Head studs
3. Race head gasket
4. Enhanced cooling
5. Oil system upgrades

## Installation

### Requirements
- Professional machine shop
- Specialized tooling
- Precision measurements
- Quality materials
- Experienced builder

### Timeline
- 2-3 weeks typical
- Additional time for parts
- Break-in period required
- Tuning afterward
