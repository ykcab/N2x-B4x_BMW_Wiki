This guide covers the closed deck conversion process for N20/N26 engines, including different deck designs and their benefits for high-performance applications.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

## Overview

The N20/N26 engine comes from the factory with an open deck design. While this is adequate for stock power levels, high-performance builds benefit significantly from closing the deck to prevent cylinder movement and improve overall strength.

## Deck Designs

### 1. Open Deck (Factory)
![Open Deck Design](/images/engine-mods/n20/open-deck.png)
- Original factory design
- Maximum coolant flow
- Limited cylinder support
- Not recommended for high boost applications

### 2. Semi-Closed Deck
![Semi-Closed Deck Design](/images/engine-mods/n20/semi-closed.jpg)
- Partial support bridges added
- Maintains good coolant flow
- Improved cylinder stability
- Suitable for moderate power increases

### 3. Full Closed Deck

![Full Closed Deck Design 2](/images/engine-mods/n20/closed-deck-2.jpg)
- Maximum cylinder support
- Optimal for high-boost applications
- Reduced coolant flow (still adequate)
- Required for serious performance builds

## Why Close the Deck?

On setups running over 30 PSI of boost, the factory open deck design can allow:
- Cylinder movement
- Head gasket failures
- Sleeve cracking
- Reduced engine longevity
- Inconsistent cylinder sealing

## Power Level Recommendations

- **Stock-300WHP:** Open deck (factory)
- **300-400WHP:** Semi-closed deck recommended
- **400WHP+:** Full closed deck required

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
For applications above 400WHP or boost levels over 30psi, a full closed deck conversion is strongly recommended to prevent engine failure.

## Conversion Process

### Required Tools
- CNC machining center
- Precision measuring equipment
- Custom deck plates
- Specialized welding equipment

### Process Steps
1. Block preparation and cleaning
2. CNC machining of support structures
3. Material addition for deck closure
4. Precision machining of deck surface
5. Quality control checks
6. Final deck surface finishing

## Considerations

### Advantages
- Increased cylinder stability
- Better head gasket sealing
- Higher boost capability
- Improved sleeve support
- Longer engine life at high power

### Disadvantages
- Higher cost
- Reduced coolant flow
- More complex machining
- Limited number of qualified shops
- Cannot be reversed

## Integration with Other Modifications

The closed deck conversion works best when combined with:
- Darton MID wet sleeves
- ARP head studs
- Performance head gaskets
- Upgraded cooling system
- Forged internal components

## Professional Installation

### Shop Requirements
1. CNC machining capabilities
2. Experience with aluminum blocks
3. Proper measuring equipment
4. Quality control procedures
5. BMW-specific expertise

## Maintenance Considerations

After closed deck conversion:
- Monitor coolant temperatures more closely
- Use high-quality coolant
- Regular compression testing
- Periodic leak-down testing
- Head gasket inspection at service intervals

## Philosophy

As stated in the original documentation: "My philosophy is do it once do it right, learn from my failures and avoid cutting corners where possible on this platform as it can become a nightmare very quickly."
