> **Important:** Regular oil analysis can detect engine problems before they become serious and help optimize oil change intervals.

## Why Analyze Oil?

### Benefits
1. Early Warning
   - Wear metal detection
   - Contamination identification
   - Additive depletion tracking
   - Coolant leak detection

2. Cost Savings
   - Prevent major failures
   - Optimize change intervals
   - Document engine health
   - Warranty documentation

## Testing Process

### Sample Collection
1. Proper Timing
   - Engine at operating temperature
   - Before oil change
   - Consistent mileage intervals
   - Representative sample

2. Collection Method
   - Clean equipment
   - Proper sample bottle
   - Vacuum pump method
   - Documentation

## What's Tested

### Standard Tests
1. Wear Metals
   - Iron (cylinder wear)
   - Aluminum (piston wear)
   - Copper (bearing wear)
   - Lead (bearing overlay)

2. Contaminants
   - Silicon (dirt)
   - Sodium (coolant)
   - Fuel dilution
   - Water content

3. Oil Condition
   - Viscosity
   - TBN/TAN
   - Oxidation
   - Additive levels

## Interpreting Results

### Key Indicators
1. Normal Wear
   - Baseline levels
   - Trend analysis
   - Break-in periods
   - Service intervals

2. Warning Signs
   - Excessive metals
   - Contamination
   - Viscosity changes
   - Additive depletion

3. Action Items
   - Shortened intervals
   - Further inspection
   - Component replacement
   - Maintenance changes
