> **Important:** Carbon buildup on intake valves is inevitable in direct injection engines. Regular cleaning maintains performance and prevents issues.

## Understanding Carbon Buildup

### Causes
1. Direct Injection Design
   - No fuel washing
   - PCV recirculation
   - Oil vapor deposits
   - EGR contribution

2. Contributing Factors
   - Short trips
   - Poor oil quality
   - PCV issues
   - Tuning/modifications

## Symptoms

### Performance Issues
1. Cold Start
   - Rough idle
   - Misfires
   - Extended cranking
   - Hesitation

2. Running Conditions
   - Power loss
   - Poor throttle response
   - Uneven idle
   - Check engine light

## Cleaning Methods

### Walnut Blasting
1. Process
   - Intake manifold removal
   - Port protection
   - Media blasting
   - Thorough cleanup

2. Equipment
   - Walnut media
   - Blasting tool
   - Vacuum system
   - Inspection camera

### Chemical Cleaning
1. Methods
   - Intake cleaning service
   - CRC intake cleaner
   - Foam cleaners
   - Professional service

2. Limitations
   - Less effective
   - Temporary solution
   - Surface cleaning only
   - Requires repetition

## Prevention

### Maintenance
1. Regular Service
   - Catch can installation
   - Oil separator maintenance
   - Quality oil use
   - Regular oil changes

2. Driving Habits
   - Allow warm-up
   - Highway driving
   - Full throttle runs
   - Avoid short trips

## Service Intervals

### Recommendations
1. Standard Use
   - 30,000-50,000 miles
   - Visual inspection
   - Performance monitoring
   - Documentation

2. Modified/Performance
   - 25,000-35,000 miles
   - More frequent checks
   - Pre-tune cleaning
   - Post-cleaning data logs
